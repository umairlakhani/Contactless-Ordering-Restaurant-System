# Contactless Ordering Restaurant System
 The food and hospitality industry has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19  pandemic, with many restaurants and cafes shifting to contactless solutions to ensure the  safety of their customers and staff. This includes the implementation of contactless  ordering systems, which allow customers to place orders and make payments without  the need for physical contact. The use of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in contactless  ordering systems is a promising approach as it allows for distributed decision-making  and coordination among agents. JADE is a popular open-source framework for  developing MAS.
